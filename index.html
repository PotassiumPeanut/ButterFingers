    <h1>Butterfingers: The Tale of a Young Squire</h1>
    <h2>(not finished)</h2>   
        <p>This tale is about a squire whose name is Scott.  Now, Scott qualifies for being a knight.  He is witty, courageous, and persevering; however, he has an affliction that still had him be a squire;  he has butterfingers.  For seven years, it seemed that Scott simply couldn’t overcome this curse that blocked his path to knighthood.  Lucky for him, he had a patient teacher, one who was the most valiant of the land, Sir Ivan.  When most of the knights turned Scott down because of his butterfingers, Sir Ivan was there, welcoming Scott as his squire.  When the other knights heard this, they were a bit confused, but they didn’t question Ivan’s decision.</p>

I need five noble knights to journey to the beast’s den to slay it and recover my daughter from that abomination’s lair.”\nOne by one, four knights and their squires come up to the the king to lend their aid.  Sir Ivan went to approach the the king, but looks back at Scott.  "Would you like to come with me on this journey?  I know you have problems wielding your arms, but I assure that you can be of help.  You can stay behind if you are not ready, and you can practice by yourself or with the other knights and squires." \n\nDoes Scott join Sir Ivan?`,

Scott is really excited to participate in this adventure, since he has always been inside the castle walls and nowhere else when it came to doing tasks.  The knights left the castle with fanfare, towards the belly of the beast.  After a week of traveling, they finally arrive. \n“There it is!” exclaims Sir Ray.  The other knights look towards the looming structure in the distance.  “Well what are you waiting for?” continued the knight,  “The princess isn’t going to rescue herself.”  The knights rush towards the collection of towers and set up camp. \nA lava moat surrounded the property, with only a frail bridge available to enter the premises.  The surrounding clouds suddenly grow ashy and the air is filled with soot.  Before the knights advance towards the dragon, Sir Ivan instructs the squires.  “Stay behind and guard the camp.  Make sure nothing happens to our equipment, we’ll be back before you know it.” The knights then leave to cross the rope bridge one by one, not risking to break it. The squires stay behind as told, guarding the horses and left over equipment in the camp.  The squires start to chatter. \n“Well, that was a tiring week.  Hadn’t used my legs that much since I was a page,” says one, in which they all agree. \n“Too bad your steed was disease-ridden and died,” heckled another squire, “because if you have had taken better care of it, you wouldn’t have had to walk all that way and we wouldn’t have slowed down for you, Steven.” \n“It’s not entirely my fault Greg, Scott over here just couldn’t help dropping everything all the time; how does that even happen, least you have a horse that can carry your equipment?” \n“Hey,” Scott replied, “it’s not my fault I--”\nThey all groan.  “Yes Scott, we know, you have ‘butterfingers’ or whatever you call it, you’ve been complaining about it ever since you’ve held a sword.  It’s numbing to our ears ever since we all became squires.  Scott, we’re all surprised you became one in the first place, let alone a squire of Sir Ivan’s.”  The squire then say some rude things and some true but also sad things about Scott which makes him a bit uneasy. \n\nScott wonders if he should leave as the person the squires are talking about is right there.`,

They all pick up their weapons, one picked up a bow, one a mace, another a sword and another squire retrieved their war hammer.

        text: `"Sir RichardRicher, in all honesty, that is a terrible plan and you are going to die" Scott responds without hesitation. \nSir RichardRicher looks disgusted.  "Well at least I have a plan, what do you have in mind?"  Before Scott could speak his mind Sir RichardRicher shuts him up.  "Exactly!" he exclaims, "You don't have one" and he pulls out his cartoonishly long sword and starts to charge in without Scott, trying to prove to him that his plan is totally not terrible and it will work miraculously somehow. \nIn a matter of seconds, Scott hears a loud roar and sees Sir RichardRicher's sad body being tossed over the castle wall, yelling curses and blames directed to the dragon and Scott respectivley. Scott looks at the dragon, who is in return looking back at him. "After sending that group of knights and squires, the king decided to send the court jester and a child to fight me?  This is absolutley hillarious, I'm just dying of laughter." \nThanks to Sir RichardRicher's folly, the dragon's guard has dropped severely since he's just poking fun at both you and the presumably late Sir RichardRicher.  Now would be a great oppurtunity to strike. As Scott goes to pull out his flail, he hears Sir RichardRicher's sword clatters against the ground. \n\n Which weapon should Scott use?`,
